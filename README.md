# virtual_microprocessor

#### Python program for the simulation/execution of low-level assembly through a high-level defined microprocessor architecture

Make an image in the format of:

>[opcode]\(tab)[arga]\(comma)(space)[argb]

or

>[opcode]\(tab)[arga]

Compile it with:

>python3.5 interp.py (name of image)

Run with:

>python3.5 main.py (name of compiled image) [-d]

## To Do:

* Documentation (for code usage)
* Proper I/O to handle keyboard input
* Improve the "compiler"
* Fixing up of the debugger
